Description: Functions to perform Bayesian nonparametric univariate and multivariate density estimation and clustering, by means of Pitman-Yor mixtures, and dependent Dirichlet process mixtures for partially exchangeable data. See Corradin et al. (2021) <doi:10.18637/jss.v100.i15> for more details.
